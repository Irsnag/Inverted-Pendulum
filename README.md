# Inverted pendulum on moving cart

## Introduction 

The Inverted Pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control systems, often used to demonstrate control theory concepts. The goal of this project is to balance an inverted pendulum on a moving cart using LQR control and compare it with Deep Reinforcement Learning. The simulation was made using python.

## Equations

The equations governing the system are :

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Items are numbered automatically.
  \item The numbers start at 1 with each use of the \texttt{enumerate} environment.
