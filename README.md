# Inverted pendulum on moving cart

## Introduction 

The Inverted Pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control systems, often used to demonstrate control theory concepts. The goal of this project is to balance an inverted pendulum on a moving cart using LQR control and compare it with Deep Reinforcement Learning. The simulation was made using python.

## Equations

The equations governing the system are :

'''
$$\mathbb{x_i} = \mathbb{F}\mathsf{x_{i-1}} + \mathbb{U_i}$$
'''
